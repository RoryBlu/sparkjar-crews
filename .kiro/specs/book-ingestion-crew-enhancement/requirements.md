# Book Ingestion Crew Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

The book ingestion crew is designed to process handwritten manuscripts from Google Drive, transcribe them using OCR and AI vision capabilities, and save the transcribed text back to Google Drive. Currently, the crew has basic functionality but lacks production readiness due to missing tests, incomplete error handling, and unimplemented features mentioned in the architecture documentation. This enhancement project will bring the crew to production standards while adding robust OCR capabilities and improving reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Production-Ready Code Quality

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the book ingestion crew to meet all production code standards so that it can be reliably deployed and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the crew SHALL have comprehensive unit and integration tests with 100% pass rate
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN no debug code, test data files, or TODO comments SHALL exist in production
3. WHEN examining error handling THEN all external API calls SHALL have proper retry logic and error recovery
4. WHEN checking configurations THEN all hardcoded values SHALL be moved to environment variables or configuration files
5. WHEN validating schemas THEN the book_ingestion_crew schema SHALL be properly defined in the database seed files

### Requirement 2: Robust OCR and Transcription Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user processing handwritten manuscripts, I want multiple OCR options so that I can achieve the best possible transcription accuracy for different types of handwriting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL support both GPT-4 Vision and PaddleOCR as transcription options
2. WHEN using PaddleOCR THEN the system SHALL automatically compress images that exceed size limits
3. WHEN transcription confidence is low THEN the system SHALL use sequential thinking for complex reasoning
4. WHEN processing multi-page documents THEN the system SHALL maintain proper page ordering and context
5. WHEN encountering unclear text THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and flag uncertain sections

### Requirement 3: Scalable File Processing

**User Story:** As a user with large manuscript collections, I want the system to handle folders with hundreds of images efficiently so that I can process entire books without timeouts or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing Google Drive folders THEN the system SHALL implement pagination for folders with more than 100 files
2. WHEN processing large batches THEN the system SHALL process images in configurable batch sizes
3. WHEN a single image fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other images and report failures
4. WHEN processing is interrupted THEN the system SHALL support resuming from the last processed image
5. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement proper cleanup between image processing

### Requirement 4: Multi-Language Support and Flexibility

**User Story:** As a user working with manuscripts in various languages, I want flexible language support so that I can process documents in any language without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying a language THEN the system SHALL accept any valid ISO 639-1 language code
2. WHEN using language-specific OCR THEN the system SHALL load appropriate language models
3. WHEN no language is specified THEN the system SHALL attempt to detect the manuscript language
4. WHEN processing mixed-language documents THEN the system SHALL handle multiple languages in the same document
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about supported languages

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Google Drive Integration

**User Story:** As a user managing manuscript projects, I want better organization and tracking in Google Drive so that I can easily find and manage transcribed documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating output files THEN the system SHALL organize them in a clear folder structure
2. WHEN saving transcriptions THEN the system SHALL include metadata about processing date, OCR method, and confidence
3. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL handle Google Drive API rate limits gracefully
4. WHEN folder permissions change THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about access issues
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL create a summary report with statistics and any issues

### Requirement 6: Job Tracking and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive job tracking so that I can monitor progress, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing starts THEN the system SHALL log detailed progress for each image
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture full error context and stack traces
3. WHEN jobs complete THEN the system SHALL provide processing time, success rate, and resource usage metrics
4. WHEN viewing job history THEN the system SHALL show which OCR method was used for each page
5. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL track OCR accuracy metrics when ground truth is available

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to customize OCR settings and processing behavior so that I can optimize for my specific manuscript types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring OCR THEN the system SHALL allow choosing between GPT-4 Vision, PaddleOCR, or both
2. WHEN setting parameters THEN the system SHALL support OCR-specific settings (e.g., image preprocessing, confidence thresholds)
3. WHEN defining output format THEN the system SHALL support plain text, markdown, and structured JSON outputs
4. WHEN processing specific manuscript types THEN the system SHALL support custom preprocessing pipelines
5. WHEN saving configurations THEN the system SHALL allow reusing settings across multiple jobs

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities so that I can validate changes and ensure reliability across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN all crew components SHALL be tested in isolation with mocked dependencies
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test with real Google Drive API using test folders
3. WHEN testing OCR accuracy THEN the system SHALL include test images with known transcriptions
4. WHEN validating error handling THEN tests SHALL simulate API failures, timeouts, and rate limits
5. WHEN measuring performance THEN tests SHALL benchmark OCR speed and accuracy across different methods
