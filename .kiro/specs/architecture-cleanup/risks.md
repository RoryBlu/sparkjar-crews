## Medium Risks (Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood)

### Risk 7: Model Name Confusion (gpt-4.1 vs gpt-4o)

**Likelihood**: High (90%)
**Impact**: Low - Confusion but not blocking
**Risk Score**: 5/10

**Indicators**:
- Model not found errors
- Documentation conflicts
- Developer confusion

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Create authoritative MODELS.md
2. Global search and replace
3. Validate model names with OpenAI API
4. Add model name validation

**Contingency Plan**:
- Model name mapping layer
- Clear error messages
- Quick documentation updates

### Risk 8: Railway Deployment Complexity

**Description**: Multi-repo deployment may be more complex than monorepo

**Likelihood**: Medium (40%)
**Impact**: Medium - Deployment delays
**Risk Score**: 5/10

**Indicators**:
- Failed deployments
- Version mismatches
- Configuration errors

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Document deployment procedures
2. Automate deployment scripts
3. Use Railway templates
4. Practice deployments in staging

**Contingency Plan**:
- Manual deployment procedures
- Railway support escalation
- Rollback to previous versions

### Risk 9: Testing Infrastructure Breakage

**Description**: Tests assume monorepo structure and may fail

**Likelihood**: High (70%)
**Impact**: Low - Development slowdown
**Risk Score**: 5/10

**Indicators**:
- Test suite failures
- CI/CD pipeline breaks
- Coverage gaps

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Update test fixtures gradually
2. Create test utilities in shared
3. Mock service boundaries
4. Separate unit from integration tests

**Contingency Plan**:
- Disable failing tests temporarily
- Manual testing procedures
- Fix tests incrementally

## Low Risks (Low Impact or Low Likelihood)
