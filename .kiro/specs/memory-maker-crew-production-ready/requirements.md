# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Memory Maker Crew is a critical component of the SparkJAR system that processes text content to extract and store structured memories. Currently, the implementation has several production-readiness issues including missing error handling, inadequate testing, hardcoded values, and inconsistent import paths. This feature aims to transform the Memory Maker Crew into a production-ready, testable, and maintainable component that follows enterprise development standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Memory Maker Crew to be production-ready with comprehensive error handling, so that it can reliably process corporate policies and other critical documents without system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Memory Maker Crew encounters an API failure THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN invalid input data is provided THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and return structured error responses
3. WHEN the memory service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the failure and provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN processing large text content THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout handling and resource management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Memory Maker Crew to have comprehensive test coverage, so that I can confidently deploy changes and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all tests SHALL pass consistently
2. WHEN testing the crew execution THEN unit tests SHALL cover all major code paths with at least 80% coverage
3. WHEN testing integration scenarios THEN integration tests SHALL verify end-to-end functionality with the memory service
4. WHEN mocking external dependencies THEN tests SHALL use proper mocking to isolate components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the Memory Maker Crew to follow clean architecture standards and eliminate code duplication, so that the system is maintainable and follows architectural best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN all hardcoded values SHALL be replaced with environment variables or configuration
2. WHEN reviewing import statements THEN all imports SHALL use consistent paths relative to the repository structure
3. WHEN checking for code duplication THEN duplicate implementations SHALL be consolidated into shared utilities
4. WHEN validating configuration THEN all configuration SHALL be centralized and type-safe using Pydantic models

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the Memory Maker Crew to have proper logging and monitoring, so that I can track execution and diagnose issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the crew executes THEN all operations SHALL be logged with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN error logs SHALL include sufficient context for debugging without exposing sensitive data
3. WHEN processing completes THEN success metrics SHALL be logged including processing time and memory count
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN debug logs SHALL be available but disabled in production by default

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the Memory Maker Crew to handle authentication and data securely, so that corporate policies and sensitive information are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the memory service THEN JWT tokens SHALL be properly generated and validated
2. WHEN processing sensitive content THEN personal data SHALL be sanitized from logs
3. WHEN storing memories THEN actor context SHALL be properly validated and enforced
4. WHEN handling errors THEN sensitive information SHALL NOT be exposed in error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the Memory Maker Crew to be easily testable with real data across all context realms, so that I can validate functionality with actual corporate policies and different actor types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL successfully process the Vervelyn Publishing corporate policy for client context
2. WHEN testing with client actor context THEN the system SHALL properly handle client actor type with ID 1d1c2154-242b-4f49-9ca8-e57129ddc823
3. WHEN testing with synth_class context THEN the system SHALL properly process and store synth_class level memories and templates
4. WHEN testing with skill_module context THEN the system SHALL properly handle skill_module specific knowledge and procedures
5. WHEN validating memory creation THEN the system SHALL create structured entities for policies, procedures, and organizational knowledge across all context realms
6. WHEN testing end-to-end THEN the system SHALL integrate with the remote Railway memory service successfully for all actor types

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a maintenance developer, I want the Memory Maker Crew to have clear documentation and examples, so that I can understand, modify, and extend the functionality efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all public methods SHALL have comprehensive docstrings with type hints
2. WHEN examining configuration THEN all configuration options SHALL be documented with examples
3. WHEN running examples THEN working examples SHALL be provided for common use cases
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN error messages SHALL be clear and actionable
