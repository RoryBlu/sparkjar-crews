## Implementation Notes for Claude Code

### Platform vs Client Entities
- **Platform entities** (E15): Core SparkJar system components - reusable across clients
- **Client entities** (E1-E14): Vervelyn-specific configurations and instances

### Key Entity Definitions
1. **Vervelyn Memory Maker Crew (E5)**: CrewAI multi-agent system with:
   - Agent configuration parameters
   - Sleep-cycle processing pattern
   - Text chunk extraction capabilities
   - API integration points

2. **Employee Categories (E2, E3)**: Distinct entities with unique attributes:
   - Different disclosure requirements
   - Category-specific metrics
   - Unique compliance needs

3. **SparkJar Memory System (E15)**: Platform-level system that Vervelyn configures/uses:
   - Not owned by Vervelyn
   - Contains Immediate Memory and Deep Archives components
   - Provides memory update processes

### Relationship Patterns
- Client → Platform: Implementation and configuration relationships
- Internal → Internal: Governance and operational relationships
- Entity → Process: Execution and accountability relationships

### Memory Curation Focus
Every entity requires tracking of:
- Current state (immediate memory)
- Historical data (deep archives)
- Relationship changes over time
- Observation timestamps for temporal queries
